# FanChart
Automatically tweet notifications of milestones for a fandom, pulled from multiple sources.

I'll pretty up and improve this repo later.  For now, it's just here to share the code.

## Setup

First, set up a Developer account on Twitter.  Expect it to take a few minutes.  Then create an app token, an app secret, a user token, and a user secret.

Second, set up an Application on YouTube.  All you need here is the API Key.

Third, either set up... ah, what was it?  Some sort of Spotify server middleman, but I'll find the link later.  You'll need the endpoint URL minus the queries.

Finally, start my program.  It will prompt you for all of the above.  Fill in the data, then it is ready to run!

## Scheduling?

Yea, it doesn't schedule automatically.  I plan to use an external tool for that, but I still need to add support for running on load before that will work.  For now, it just has to be run manually from the menu.

## Future Updates

For the next week, I'll work on coding for edge cases, prettying up the code, and prettying up the output.  I may make the settings a little more flexible too.  We'll see what I have time to do.
